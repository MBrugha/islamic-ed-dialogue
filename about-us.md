## About us

This course was developed by Meaghan Brugha, a PhD student at the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge. Meaghan is part of the Cambridge Educational Dialogue Research group (CEDiR) at the faculty, where she is exploring how technology can afford new forms of dialogue to support the development of a teacher community of practice in which practitioners reflect together, support one another, and share practice. Her research draws heavily on the work of the Teacher Scheme for Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA), and its impact acceleration [project](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/programmes/tseda/).

T-SEDA is an extensive, open resource pack that was designed to support practitioner inquiries and offers customisable coding tools and templates. For full downloadable copies of the pack, scroll to the bottom of the page and choose the language that you want.

CEDiR is a research group within the Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge that draws together a range of Faculty colleagues who are interested in educational dialogue and aim to create and share high quality research. You can subscribe to the CEDiR newsletter at the bottom of the [CEDiR webpage](https://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/research/groups/cedir/).
