## Week one: An introduction to educational dialogue

'Thinking and discourse are the same thing, except that what we call thinking is, precisely, the inward dialogue carried on by the mind itself without a spoken sound' (Plato, Sophist, #268)

Welcome to week one! All of the content, activities and tasks for week one are included on this page. Scroll down to review each section. In this initial session, we will focus on understanding the distinction between educational dialogue and classroom talk as well as the relationship of dialogue to thinking and learning. We also look at how dialogue differs from oracy and the relationship between the two. We provide terminology and outline the development of dialogic educational theories and practices.
